Inconsistent Code Detection for Java

For further information please see the [Bixie website](http://csl.sri.com/projects/bixie/).

Bixe uses [Jar2Bpl](https://github.com/martinschaef/jar2bpl) to turn Java into Boogie, and [GraVy](https://github.com/martinschaef/gravy) to find inconsistent code in Booige.
